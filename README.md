# VoronV0.1ConfigFiles
Some of my personal config and firmware files for the Voron v0.1. Be warned, this is for my printer and not specifically yours. Mine has a Hemera attached to the back of it as a bowden system instead of the normal direct drive head on the v0.1, so it is not the same.

In here are my printer.cfg, klipper.bin and superslicer configs for my Beige Voron.
