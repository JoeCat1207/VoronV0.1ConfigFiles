# VoronV0.1ConfigFiles
Some of my personal config and firmware files for the Voron v0.1. Be warned, this is for my printer and not specifically yours. Mine has a Hemera attached to the back of it as a bowden system instead of the normal direct drive head on the v0.1, so it is not the same.

In here are my printer.cfg, klipper.bin and superslicer configs for my Beige Voron.

I will keep this public for the sake of example. The sole reason it is on github is that I am severely dumb and require multiple backup routes if I were to lose said files. I have done so before and I will not be bothered to recompile the whole thing again.
